Hi there 👋

- 👩🏻‍🎓 I am a PhD student studying vascular health and changes in disease.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on collating scRNA Seq data in order to build a comprehensive profile of the aorta!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ins and outs of bioinformatics! My current skills include basics in Linux, and advanced data analysis in R. I am looking to improve my skills in Python and learn more about generative AI.
