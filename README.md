# Hi there

👩🏻‍🎓 **About me**  
I’m a PhD student researching vascular health and how it changes in disease.  
My current project focuses on **developing a multi-omics approach** to build a comprehensive profile of the aorta.  

🔭 **Research interests**  
- Cardiovascular disease & aortic biology  
- Multi-omics integration (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics)  
- Single-cell and bulk RNA-seq  

🌱 **Currently learning**  
- Bioinformatics foundations: ![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?logo=linux&logoColor=black), HPC, reproducible workflows  
- Advanced data analysis in ![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-276DC3?logo=r&logoColor=white) (DESeq2, Seurat, tidyverse)  
- Expanding into ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white) for data science & workflow automation  
- Exploring **generative AI** applications in biology
