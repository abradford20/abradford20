# Hi there 👋

👩🏻‍🎓 **About me**  
I’m a PhD student researching vascular health and how it changes in disease.  
My current project focuses on **developing a multi-omics approach** to build a comprehensive profile of the aorta.  

🔭 **Research interests**  
- Cardiovascular disease & aortic biology  
- Multi-omics integration (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics)  
- Single-cell and bulk RNA-seq  

🌱 **Currently learning**  
- Bioinformatics foundations: Linux, HPC, reproducible workflows  
- Advanced data analysis in **R** (DESeq2, Seurat, tidyverse)  
- Expanding into **Python** for data science & workflow automation  
- Exploring **generative AI** applications in biology  

📂 **Pinned repositories**  
➡️ Check out some of my projects below (bulk RNA-seq pipelines, single-cell analysis, and utility scripts).
